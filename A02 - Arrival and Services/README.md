## Arrivals and Services

The files _Trace1.csv_, _Trace2.csv_ and _Trace3.csv_ contains two columns: the first is the inter-arrival
time between two consecutive jobs to a system, and the second one contains their corresponding service time.

Assuming that jobs are served in order of arrival, one at a time and without interruption, using the results seen last time, 
the computed values are:

- the average response time
- the system utilization
- the frequency at which the system returns idle
- the average idle time
