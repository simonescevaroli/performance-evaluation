## Basic Performance Indices and Workloads

The file _barrier.log_ contains line in the following format: `[yyyy:ddd:hh:mm:ss:f][eeee]` <br>

Assuming that jobs are served in the order of arrival, one at a time, and not interrupted, the computed indices are:
- Arrival rate and throughput
- Average inter-arrival time
- Utilization
- Average Service Time
- Average Number of Jobs
- Average Response Time
- Probability of having m parts in the machine (with m = 0, 1, 2)
- Probability of having a response time less than τ, (with τ = 30 sec, 3 min)
- Probability of having an inter-arrival time shorter than τ, (with τ = 1 min)
- Probability of having a service time longer than τ, (with τ = 1 min)
